<h1>Oldschool Runescape Quest Filter</h1>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<ul>
<li>rsquestfilter is an Application written by "Elite Orin" and "Aluminoti" that filters quests based on a players highscores and their quests completed. The purpose of this app is to show you what quests you can currently complete in game. </li>

<li>This app saves your data in a save file. If I were to save my data, my save file would be "elite orin.save". It is important that you leave these files if you want</li>
</ul>

<h2>How to use</h2>

<ol>
<li>First, type in your OSRS username into the login area when you first start up the application. This will result in it calling the runescape API to look up your hiscores.</li>
<li>Second, You will see a list of all the quests in the game in red. You should go through all of these and right click each quest that you have already completed. This will mark them as "complete", leading to more accurate filtering when seeing which quests you can complete.</li>
<li>After you have finished marking the quests as complete, you can now filter the quests. There are two checkboxes at the bottom you can use to filter that we have defined. One is to hide completed quests, and the other is to only show quests you can complete. Both of these can be checked at a time. There is also a textbox you can use to search for a specific quest. You may need to uncheck the checkboxes for this to work properly.</li>
</ol>
